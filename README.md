# Netflix-Analysis

Netflix has a dataset that has information about all the movies on the streaming app. There is a lot of useful information about movies within the dataset. The dataset has the following column names: 
•	Show id – An id to represent a movie or tv show. 
•	Title – The title of the movie or tv show. 
•	Director – Who directed the piece. 
•	Cast – Who was in the film or tv show. 
•	Country – Which country the show or movie is in. 
•	Date added – The date it was added to the Netflix. 
•	Release year – The year the movie or show came out. 
•	Rating – The rating of the movie or show (G, PG, PG-13, R, TV-14, TV-MA) 
•	Duration – The length of the movie or how many seasons the tv show has. 
•	Listed in – The categories the movie or tv show is listed in. 
•	Description – A short description of the show or movie. 
•	Type – Whether it’s a movie or tv show. 

The idea is to use all of this information to create a preditction on whether the incoming movie/tv show is a movie or if it is a tv show.
